A simple Power Meter you can use to measure 0-26V and up to 3.2A. It makes a great addition to your workshop by allowing you to monitor voltage, current, power and energy used over time on almost any DC device.

It uses a INA219 [High Side DC Voltage and Current I2C Module](https://www.aliexpress.com/item/Free-shipping-Zero-drift-CJMCU-219-INA219-I2C-interface-Bi-directional-current-power-monitoring-sensor/32688147341.html). These are very cheap.
